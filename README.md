# Compiler-PL0
This the final programming assignment of the course *Principles and Techniques of Compiler* in 2017 fall semester.
Group members: Xin Li, Zhiwei Zhou, and me.
Many operators and functions used in *c* were added, also program control structures, such as *for* loop and *switch* and so on. We added array and parameter passing in functions as well.
